This repository provides the header file and the shared library of the doubly linked list.
A simple test program is provided (under target 'test' in the makefile), but the doubly linked list
shall be used in custom programs. Just link your program agains the provided (x86_64 architecture) shared library object:

LDFLAGS += -L. -ldll

and be sure to include the current directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For that matter, a dummy target 'run' has been added
in the makefile, so the sample test program can be run with

make run
